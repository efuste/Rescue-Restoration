                <p>In a typical scenario after a fire, when the fire trucks leave the property and the caution tapes are torn down, most people think that the danger is gone. However, lurking underneath the ashes there may remain other hazardous conditions. That is because during the fire, some volatile vapors and soot residues accumulate on structural surfaces and contents. This usually happens by the rising and the expanding of the air, or by the air conditioning units which transfer those elements to different areas and surfaces of the property.
                    Pro-longed neutralization, cleaning, and corrosion control leads to higher restoration costs as well as escalating cost of damages. Combustion releases harmful toxins into the environment capable of aggravating respiratory illness, or other medical conditions. The following is a timeline of the effects of fire and smoke on a home:
                </p>

                <h5 class="single-subtitle red">What You Can Expect</h5>

                <p>Our restoration proffesionals will safely and effectively employ cleaning methods and specialized restoration chemicals capable of removing soot from all affected structural materials, as well as from structural surfaces, to ensure that soot and other damage will not become permanently embedded in the structure.
                    Rescue Restoration Services professionals will pack and safely store your contents and then proceed to eliminate smoke as well as fire related odors from the property.</p>
                <p><strong>Minutes:</strong> Acid soot residues cause plastics to yellow; small appliances located close to the source of combustion discolor; highly porous materials (marble, alabaster) discolor permanently.</p>
                <p><strong>Hours:</strong> Acid residues stain grout in bathrooms; fiberglass bath fixtures may yellow; uncoated metals tarnish, counter tops may yellow; finishes on appliances, particularly refrigerators, may yellow; furniture finishes may discolor.</p>
                <p><strong>Days:</strong> In time, acid residues cause painted walls to yellow permanently; metal corrodes, pits and rusts; wood furniture requires refinishing; vinyl flooring requires refinishing or replaceÂ­ment; clothing becomes soot stained; upholstery stains permanently.</p>
                <p><strong>Weeks:</strong> Restoration costs escalate tremendously. Synthetic carpet fibers may yellow or discolor permanently; silver plate is corroded permanently; glass, crystal, china may require replacement due to severe etching and pitting caused by prolonged exposure to acid soot residues.</p>

                <h5 class="single-subtitle red">Our Four Step Process</h5>
                     <ul class="list-items">
                         <li>Remove the source of the odor, as possible, including unsalvageable debris that contributes to odor generation and recontamination of cleaned and deodorized areas.</li>
                         <li>Clean salvageable surfaces and items in order to remove odor-causing residue.</li>
                         <li>Eliminate any remaining odor with a counteractant. In the case of smoke, we use a deodorizing fog or gas that seeks out and combines with odor-causing substances.</li>
                         <li>Seal salvageable surfaces that are inaccessible or slightly scorched, not only for aesthetic purposes, but primarily to encapsulate odor and prevent progressive recontamination.</li>
                     </ul>
