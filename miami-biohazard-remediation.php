                <p>Mold becomes a problem inside a home or business when there's excessive humidity or moisture for an extended period of time. The problem can originate from a burst pipe, large spill that goes untreated, or from a chronic condition, such as a leaking roof or plumbing. Even high humidity or warm, moist air condensing on cool surfaces can trigger mold problems.
                    In the event that water damage has been present for too long, mold will occur. Thus, Rescue Restoration Services professionals will identify moisture sources, evaluate mold growth (visible or suspected), contain damage, remove contamination and dry materials to prevent mold growth.</p>

                <h5 class="single-subtitle yellow">What You Can Expect</h5>

                <p>The first step is to contain the contaminated section to protect the unaffected areas from cross-contamination. Once this barrier has been set, and negative pressure created inside the containment, the removal process can start.
                    Typically, affected drywall and carpeting are removed, exposing the structure for further examination. Depending on the severity of the problem, Rescue Restoration Services executes a multi-faceted approach, using the proper equipment and know-how to handle the particular infestation safely and make the premises habitable and as quickly as possible to save money  for our clients.
                    Once the mold has been removed, we thoroughly HEPA vacuum and damp wipe with a fungicide, all surfaces within the containment. Finally, we bring an independent testing company to test surfaces and air samples to certify that we have done our job thoroughly. After passing post-testing, we can seal the surfaces that were affected by mold. From this point on, your property is ready for either habitation or reconstruction, if needed.</p>
